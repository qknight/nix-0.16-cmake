<title>Bugs / To-Do</title>


<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>The man-pages generated from the DocBook documentation
are ugly.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Generations properly form a tree.  E.g., if after
switching to generation 39, we perform an installation action, a
generation 43 is created which is a descendant of 39, not 42.  So a
rollback from 43 ought to go back to 39.  This is not currently
implemented; generations form a linear sequence.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>For security, <command>nix-push</command> manifests
should be digitally signed, and <command>nix-pull</command> should
verify the signatures.  The actual NAR archives in the cache do not
need to be signed, since the manifest contains cryptographic hashes of
these files (and <filename>fetchurl.nix</filename> checks
them).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>It would be useful to have an option in
<command>nix-env --delete-generations</command> to remove non-current
generations older than a certain age.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>There should be a flexible way to change the user
environment builder.  Currently, you have to replace
<filename><replaceable>prefix</replaceable>/share/nix/corepkgs/buildenv/builder.pl</filename>,
which is hard-coded into <command>nix-env</command>.  Also, the
default builder should be more powerful.  For instance, there should
be some way to specify priorities to resolve
collisions.</para></listitem>
