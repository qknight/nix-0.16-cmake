<title>Nix Release Notes</title>



<!--==================================================================-->

<section xml:id="ssec-relnotes-0.16"><title>Release 0.16 (August 17, 2010)</title>

<para>This release has the following improvements:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>The Nix expression evaluator is now much faster in most
    cases: typically, <link
    xlink:href="http://www.mail-archive.com/nix-dev@cs.uu.nl/msg04113.html">3
    to 8 times compared to the old implementation</link>.  It also
    uses less memory.  It no longer depends on the ATerm
    library.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Support for configurable parallelism inside builders.  Build
      scripts have always had the ability to perform multiple build
      actions in parallel (for instance, by running <command>make -j
      2</command>), but this was not desirable because the number of
      actions to be performed in parallel was not configurable.  Nix
      now has an option <option>--cores
      <replaceable>N</replaceable></option> as well as a configuration
      setting <varname>build-cores =
      <replaceable>N</replaceable></varname> that causes the
      environment variable <envar>NIX_BUILD_CORES</envar> to be set to
      <replaceable>N</replaceable> when the builder is invoked.  The
      builder can use this at its discretion to perform a parallel
      build, e.g., by calling <command>make -j
      <replaceable>N</replaceable></command>.  In Nixpkgs, this can be
      enabled on a per-package basis by setting the derivation
      attribute <varname>enableParallelBuilding</varname> to
      <literal>true</literal>.
    </para>

<!--==================================================================-->

<section xml:id="ssec-relnotes-0.15"><title>Release 0.15 (March 17, 2010)</title>

<para>This is a bug-fix release.  Among other things, it fixes
building on Mac OS X (Snow Leopard), and improves the contents of
<filename>/etc/passwd</filename> and <filename>/etc/group</filename>
in <literal>chroot</literal> builds.</para>

</section>


<!--==================================================================-->

<section xml:id="ssec-relnotes-0.14"><title>Release 0.14 (February 4, 2010)</title>

<para>This release has the following improvements:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>The garbage collector now starts deleting garbage much
    faster than before.  It no longer determines liveness of all paths
    in the store, but does so on demand.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Added a new operation, <command>nix-store --query
    --roots</command>, that shows the garbage collector roots that
    directly or indirectly point to the given store paths.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Removed support for converting Berkeley DB-based Nix
    databases to the new schema.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Removed the <option>--use-atime</option> and
    <option>--max-atime</option> garbage collector options.  They were
    not very useful in practice.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>On Windows, Nix now requires Cygwin 1.7.x.</para>

<!--==================================================================-->

<section xml:id="ssec-relnotes-0.13"><title>Release 0.13 (November 5,
2009)</title>

<para>This is primarily a bug fix release.  It has some new
features:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>Syntactic sugar for writing nested attribute sets.  Instead of

<programlisting>
{
  foo = {
    bar = 123;
    xyzzy = true;
  };
  a = { b = { c = "d"; }; };
}
</programlisting>

    you can write

<programlisting>
{
  foo.bar = 123;
  foo.xyzzy = true;
  a.b.c = "d";
}
</programlisting>

    This is useful, for instance, in NixOS configuration files.</para>
    
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Support for Nix channels generated by Hydra, the Nix-based
    continuous build system.  (Hydra generates NAR archives on the
    fly, so the size and hash of these archives isn’t known in
    advance.)</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Support <literal>i686-linux</literal> builds directly on
    <literal>x86_64-linux</literal> Nix installations.  This is
    implemented using the <function>personality()</function> syscall,
    which causes <command>uname</command> to return
    <literal>i686</literal> in child processes.</para>
  </listitem>
  
  <listitem>
    <para>Various improvements to the <literal>chroot</literal>
    support.  Building in a <literal>chroot</literal> works quite well
    now.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix no longer blocks if it tries to build a path and another
    process is already building the same path.  Instead it tries to
    build another buildable path first.  This improves
    parallelism.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Support for large (> 4 GiB) files in NAR archives.</para>
  </listitem>
    
  <listitem>
    <para>Various (performance) improvements to the remote build
    mechanism.</para>
  </listitem>
    
  <listitem>
    <para>New primops: <varname>builtins.addErrorContext</varname> (to
    add a string to stack traces — useful for debugging),
    <varname>builtins.isBool</varname>,
    <varname>builtins.isString</varname>,
    <varname>builtins.isInt</varname>,
    <varname>builtins.intersectAttrs</varname>.</para>

  <listitem>
    <para>OpenSolaris support (Sander van der Burg).</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Stack traces are no longer displayed unless the
    <option>--show-trace</option> option is used.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The scoping rules for <literal>inherit
    (<replaceable>e</replaceable>) ...</literal> in recursive
    attribute sets have changed.  The expression
    <replaceable>e</replaceable> can now refer to the attributes
    defined in the containing set.</para>

<!--==================================================================-->

<section xml:id="ssec-relnotes-0.12"><title>Release 0.12 (November 20,
2008)</title>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix no longer uses Berkeley DB to store Nix store metadata.
    The principal advantages of the new storage scheme are: it works
    properly over decent implementations of NFS (allowing Nix stores
    to be shared between multiple machines); no recovery is needed
    when a Nix process crashes; no write access is needed for
    read-only operations; no more running out of Berkeley DB locks on
    certain operations.</para>

    <para>You still need to compile Nix with Berkeley DB support if
    you want Nix to automatically convert your old Nix store to the
    new schema.  If you don’t need this, you can build Nix with the
    <filename>configure</filename> option
    <option>--disable-old-db-compat</option>.</para>

    <para>After the automatic conversion to the new schema, you can
    delete the old Berkeley DB files:

    <screen>
$ cd /nix/var/nix/db
$ rm __db* log.* derivers references referrers reserved validpaths DB_CONFIG</screen>

    The new metadata is stored in the directories
    <filename>/nix/var/nix/db/info</filename> and
    <filename>/nix/var/nix/db/referrer</filename>.  Though the
    metadata is stored in human-readable plain-text files, they are
    not intended to be human-editable, as Nix is rather strict about
    the format.</para>

    <para>The new storage schema may or may not require less disk
    space than the Berkeley DB environment, mostly depending on the
    cluster size of your file system.  With 1 KiB clusters (which
    seems to be the <literal>ext3</literal> default nowadays) it
    usually takes up much less space.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem><para>There is a new substituter that copies paths
  directly from other (remote) Nix stores mounted somewhere in the
  filesystem.  For instance, you can speed up an installation by
  mounting some remote Nix store that already has the packages in
  question via NFS or <literal>sshfs</literal>.  The environment
  variable <envar>NIX_OTHER_STORES</envar> specifies the locations of
  the remote Nix directories,
  e.g. <literal>/mnt/remote-fs/nix</literal>.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>New <command>nix-store</command> operations
  <option>--dump-db</option> and <option>--load-db</option> to dump
  and reload the Nix database.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The garbage collector has a number of new options to
  allow only some of the garbage to be deleted.  The option
  <option>--max-freed <replaceable>N</replaceable></option> tells the
  collector to stop after at least <replaceable>N</replaceable> bytes
  have been deleted.  The option <option>--max-links
  <replaceable>N</replaceable></option> tells it to stop after the
  link count on <filename>/nix/store</filename> has dropped below
  <replaceable>N</replaceable>.  This is useful for very large Nix
  stores on filesystems with a 32000 subdirectories limit (like
  <literal>ext3</literal>).  The option <option>--use-atime</option>
  causes store paths to be deleted in order of ascending last access
  time.  This allows non-recently used stuff to be deleted.  The
  option <option>--max-atime <replaceable>time</replaceable></option>
  specifies an upper limit to the last accessed time of paths that may
  be deleted.  For instance,

    <screen>
    $ nix-store --gc -v --max-atime $(date +%s -d "2 months ago")</screen>

  deletes everything that hasn’t been accessed in two months.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para><command>nix-env</command> now uses optimistic
  profile locking when performing an operation like installing or
  upgrading, instead of setting an exclusive lock on the profile.
  This allows multiple <command>nix-env -i / -u / -e</command>
  operations on the same profile in parallel.  If a
  <command>nix-env</command> operation sees at the end that the profile
  was changed in the meantime by another process, it will just
  restart.  This is generally cheap because the build results are
  still in the Nix store.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The option <option>--dry-run</option> is now
  supported by <command>nix-store -r</command> and
  <command>nix-build</command>.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The information previously shown by
  <option>--dry-run</option> (i.e., which derivations will be built
  and which paths will be substituted) is now always shown by
  <command>nix-env</command>, <command>nix-store -r</command> and
  <command>nix-build</command>.  The total download size of
  substitutable paths is now also shown.  For instance, a build will
  show something like

    <screen>
the following derivations will be built:
  /nix/store/129sbxnk5n466zg6r1qmq1xjv9zymyy7-activate-configuration.sh.drv
  /nix/store/7mzy971rdm8l566ch8hgxaf89x7lr7ik-upstart-jobs.drv
  ...
the following paths will be downloaded/copied (30.02 MiB):
  /nix/store/4m8pvgy2dcjgppf5b4cj5l6wyshjhalj-samba-3.2.4
  /nix/store/7h1kwcj29ip8vk26rhmx6bfjraxp0g4l-libunwind-0.98.6
  ...</screen>      
  
  </para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Language features:

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para>@-patterns as in Haskell.  For instance, in a
      function definition

      <programlisting>f = args @ {x, y, z}: <replaceable>...</replaceable>;</programlisting>

      <varname>args</varname> refers to the argument as a whole, which
      is further pattern-matched against the attribute set pattern
      <literal>{x, y, z}</literal>.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>“<literal>...</literal>” (ellipsis) patterns.
      An attribute set pattern can now say <literal>...</literal>  at
      the end of the attribute name list to specify that the function
      takes <emphasis>at least</emphasis> the listed attributes, while
      ignoring additional attributes.  For instance,

      <programlisting>{stdenv, fetchurl, fuse, ...}: <replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

      defines a function that accepts any attribute set that includes
      at least the three listed attributes.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>New primops:
      <varname>builtins.parseDrvName</varname> (split a package name
      string like <literal>"nix-0.12pre12876"</literal> into its name

  <listitem><para>Removed the commands

<!--==================================================================-->

<section xml:id="ssec-relnotes-0.11"><title>Release 0.11 (December 31,
2007)</title>

<para>Nix 0.11 has many improvements over the previous stable release.
The most important improvement is secure multi-user support.  It also
features many usability enhancements and language extensions, many of
them prompted by NixOS, the purely functional Linux distribution based
on Nix.  Here is an (incomplete) list:</para>


<itemizedlist>


  <listitem><para>Secure multi-user support.  A single Nix store can
  now be shared between multiple (possible untrusted) users.  This is
  an important feature for NixOS, where it allows non-root users to
  install software.  The old setuid method for sharing a store between
  multiple users has been removed.  Details for setting up a
  multi-user store can be found in the manual.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>The new command <command>nix-copy-closure</command>
  gives you an easy and efficient way to exchange software between
  machines.  It copies the missing parts of the closure of a set of
  store path to or from a remote machine via
  <command>ssh</command>.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>A new kind of string literal: strings between double
  single-quotes (<literal>''</literal>) have indentation
  “intelligently” removed.  This allows large strings (such as shell
  scripts or configuration file fragments in NixOS) to cleanly follow
  the indentation of the surrounding expression.  It also requires
  much less escaping, since <literal>''</literal> is less common in
  most languages than <literal>"</literal>.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-env</command> <option>--set</option>
  modifies the current generation of a profile so that it contains
  exactly the specified derivation, and nothing else.  For example,
  <literal>nix-env -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/browser --set
  firefox</literal> lets the profile named
  <filename>browser</filename> contain just Firefox.</para></listitem>
  

  <listitem><para><command>nix-env</command> now maintains
  meta-information about installed packages in profiles.  The
  meta-information is the contents of the <varname>meta</varname>
  attribute of derivations, such as <varname>description</varname> or
  <varname>homepage</varname>.  The command <literal>nix-env -q --xml
  --meta</literal> shows all meta-information.</para></listitem>

  
  <listitem><para><command>nix-env</command> now uses the
  <varname>meta.priority</varname> attribute of derivations to resolve
  filename collisions between packages.  Lower priority values denote
  a higher priority.  For instance, the GCC wrapper package and the
  Binutils package in Nixpkgs both have a file
  <filename>bin/ld</filename>, so previously if you tried to install
  both you would get a collision.  Now, on the other hand, the GCC
  wrapper declares a higher priority than Binutils, so the former’s
  <filename>bin/ld</filename> is symlinked in the user
  environment.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-env -i / -u</command>: instead of
  breaking package ties by version, break them by priority and version
  number.  That is, if there are multiple packages with the same name,
  then pick the package with the highest priority, and only use the
  version if there are multiple packages with the same
  priority.</para>

  <para>This makes it possible to mark specific versions/variant in
  Nixpkgs more or less desirable than others.  A typical example would
  be a beta version of some package (e.g.,
  <literal>gcc-4.2.0rc1</literal>) which should not be installed even
  though it is the highest version, except when it is explicitly
  selected (e.g., <literal>nix-env -i
  gcc-4.2.0rc1</literal>).</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-env --set-flag</command> allows meta
  attributes of installed packages to be modified.  There are several
  attributes that can be usefully modified, because they affect the
  behaviour of <command>nix-env</command> or the user environment
  build script:

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para><varname>meta.priority</varname> can be changed
      to resolve filename clashes (see above).</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><varname>meta.keep</varname> can be set to
      <literal>true</literal> to prevent the package from being
      upgraded or replaced.  Useful if you want to hang on to an older
      version of a package.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><varname>meta.active</varname> can be set to
      <literal>false</literal> to “disable” the package.  That is, no
      symlinks will be generated to the files of the package, but it
      remains part of the profile (so it won’t be garbage-collected).
      Set it back to <literal>true</literal> to re-enable the
      package.</para></listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

  </para></listitem>

  
  <listitem><para><command>nix-env -q</command> now has a flag
  <option>--prebuilt-only</option> (<option>-b</option>) that causes
  <command>nix-env</command> to show only those derivations whose
  output is already in the Nix store or that can be substituted (i.e.,
  downloaded from somewhere).  In other words, it shows the packages
  that can be installed “quickly”, i.e., don’t need to be built from
  source.  The <option>-b</option> flag is also available in
  <command>nix-env -i</command> and <command>nix-env -u</command> to
  filter out derivations for which no pre-built binary is
  available.</para></listitem>
  

  <listitem><para>The new option <option>--argstr</option> (in
  <command>nix-env</command>, <command>nix-instantiate</command> and
  <command>nix-build</command>) is like <option>--arg</option>, except
  that the value is a string.  For example, <literal>--argstr system
  i686-linux</literal> is equivalent to <literal>--arg system
  \"i686-linux\"</literal> (note that <option>--argstr</option>
  prevents annoying quoting around shell arguments).</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-store</command> has a new operation
  <option>--read-log</option> (<option>-l</option>)
  <parameter>paths</parameter> that shows the build log of the given
  paths.</para></listitem>

  
  <!--
  <listitem><para>TODO: semantic cleanups of string concatenation
  etc. (mostly in r6740).</para></listitem>
  -->


  <listitem><para>Nix now uses Berkeley DB 4.5.  The database is
  upgraded automatically, but you should be careful not to use old
  versions of Nix that still use Berkeley DB 4.4.</para></listitem>


  <!-- foo
  <listitem><para>TODO: option <option>- -reregister</option> in
  <command>nix-store - -register-validity</command>.</para></listitem>
  -->


  <listitem><para>The option <option>--max-silent-time</option>
  (corresponding to the configuration setting
  <literal>build-max-silent-time</literal>) allows you to set a
  timeout on builds — if a build produces no output on
  <literal>stdout</literal> or <literal>stderr</literal> for the given
  number of seconds, it is terminated.  This is useful for recovering
  automatically from builds that are stuck in an infinite
  loop.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-channel</command>: each subscribed
  channel is its own attribute in the top-level expression generated
  for the channel.  This allows disambiguation (e.g. <literal>nix-env
  -i -A nixpkgs_unstable.firefox</literal>).</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>The substitutes table has been removed from the
  database.  This makes operations such as <command>nix-pull</command>
  and <command>nix-channel --update</command> much, much
  faster.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-pull</command> now supports
  bzip2-compressed manifests.  This speeds up
  channels.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-prefetch-url</command> now has a
  limited form of caching.  This is used by
  <command>nix-channel</command> to prevent unnecessary downloads when
  the channel hasn’t changed.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-prefetch-url</command> now by default
  computes the SHA-256 hash of the file instead of the MD5 hash.  In
  calls to <function>fetchurl</function> you should pass the
  <literal>sha256</literal> attribute instead of
  <literal>md5</literal>.  You can pass either a hexadecimal or a
  base-32 encoding of the hash.</para></listitem>

  
  <listitem><para>Nix can now perform builds in an automatically
  generated “chroot”.  This prevents a builder from accessing stuff
  outside of the Nix store, and thus helps ensure purity.  This is an
  experimental feature.</para></listitem>
  

  <listitem><para>The new command <command>nix-store
  --optimise</command> reduces Nix store disk space usage by finding
  identical files in the store and hard-linking them to each other.
  It typically reduces the size of the store by something like
  25-35%.</para></listitem>

  
  <listitem><para><filename>~/.nix-defexpr</filename> can now be a
  directory, in which case the Nix expressions in that directory are
  combined into an attribute set, with the file names used as the
  names of the attributes.  The command <command>nix-env
  --import</command> (which set the
  <filename>~/.nix-defexpr</filename> symlink) is
  removed.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>Derivations can specify the new special attribute
  <varname>allowedReferences</varname> to enforce that the references
  in the output of a derivation are a subset of a declared set of
  paths.  For example, if <varname>allowedReferences</varname> is an
  empty list, then the output must not have any references.  This is
  used in NixOS to check that generated files such as initial ramdisks
  for booting Linux don’t have any dependencies.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>The new attribute
  <varname>exportReferencesGraph</varname> allows builders access to
  the references graph of their inputs.  This is used in NixOS for
  tasks such as generating ISO-9660 images that contain a Nix store
  populated with the closure of certain paths.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>Fixed-output derivations (like
  <function>fetchurl</function>) can define the attribute
  <varname>impureEnvVars</varname> to allow external environment
  variables to be passed to builders.  This is used in Nixpkgs to
  support proxy configuration, among other things.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>Several new built-in functions:
  <function>builtins.attrNames</function>,
  <function>builtins.filterSource</function>,
  <function>builtins.isAttrs</function>,
  <function>builtins.isFunction</function>,
  <function>builtins.listToAttrs</function>,
  <function>builtins.stringLength</function>,
  <function>builtins.sub</function>,
  <function>builtins.substring</function>,

  computed by <function>derivation</function>).</para>

  <para>For example, the expression <literal>derivation

  <programlisting>
attrs // {
  type = "derivation";
  outPath = derivation! attrs;
  drvPath = derivation! attrs;
}</programlisting>

  where <function>derivation!</function> is a primop that does the

<section><title>Release 0.8 (April 11, 2005)</title>

<para>NOTE: the hashing scheme in Nix 0.8 changed (as detailed below).
As a result, <command>nix-pull</command> manifests and channels built
for Nix 0.7 and below will now work anymore.  However, the Nix
expression language has not changed, so you can still build from
source.  Also, existing user environments continue to work.  Nix 0.8
will automatically upgrade the database schema of previous
installations when it is first run.</para>

<para>If you get the error message

<screen>
you have an old-style manifest `/nix/var/nix/manifests/[...]'; please
delete it</screen>

you should delete previously downloaded manifests:

<screen>
$ rm /nix/var/nix/manifests/*</screen>

If <command>nix-channel</command> gives the error message

<screen>
manifest `http://catamaran.labs.cs.uu.nl/dist/nix/channels/[channel]/MANIFEST'
is too old (i.e., for Nix &lt;= 0.7)</screen>

then you should unsubscribe from the offending channel
(<command>nix-channel --remove
<replaceable>URL</replaceable></command>; leave out
<literal>/MANIFEST</literal>), and subscribe to the same URL, with
<literal>channels</literal> replaced by <literal>channels-v3</literal>
(e.g., <link
xlink:href='http://catamaran.labs.cs.uu.nl/dist/nix/channels-v3/nixpkgs-unstable'
/>).</para>

<para>Nix 0.8 has the following improvements:

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem><para>The cryptographic hashes used in store paths are now
  160 bits long, but encoded in base-32 so that they are still only 32
  characters long (e.g.,
  <filename>/nix/store/csw87wag8bqlqk7ipllbwypb14xainap-atk-1.9.0</filename>).
  (This is actually a 160 bit truncation of a SHA-256
  hash.)</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Big cleanups and simplifications of the basic store
  semantics.  The notion of “closure store expressions” is gone (and
  so is the notion of “successors”); the file system references of a
  store path are now just stored in the database.</para>

  <para>For instance, given any store path, you can query its closure:

  <screen>
$ nix-store -qR $(which firefox)
... lots of paths ...</screen>

  Also, Nix now remembers for each store path the derivation that
  built it (the “deriver”):

  <screen>
$ nix-store -qR $(which firefox)
/nix/store/4b0jx7vq80l9aqcnkszxhymsf1ffa5jd-firefox-1.0.1.drv</screen>

  So to see the build-time dependencies, you can do

  <screen>
$ nix-store -qR $(nix-store -qd $(which firefox))</screen>

  or, in a nicer format:

  <screen>
$ nix-store -q --tree $(nix-store -qd $(which firefox))</screen>

  </para>

  <para>File system references are also stored in reverse.  For
  instance, you can query all paths that directly or indirectly use a
  certain Glibc:

  <screen>
$ nix-store -q --referrers-closure \
    /nix/store/8lz9yc6zgmc0vlqmn2ipcpkjlmbi51vv-glibc-2.3.4</screen>

  </para>
  
  </listitem>

  <listitem><para>The concept of fixed-output derivations has been
  formalised.  Previously, functions such as
  <function>fetchurl</function> in Nixpkgs used a hack (namely,
  explicitly specifying a store path hash) to prevent changes to, say,
  the URL of the file from propagating upwards through the dependency
  graph, causing rebuilds of everything.  This can now be done cleanly
  by specifying the <varname>outputHash</varname> and
  <varname>outputHashAlgo</varname> attributes.  Nix itself checks
  that the content of the output has the specified hash.  (This is
  important for maintaining certain invariants necessary for future
  work on secure shared stores.)</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>One-click installation :-) It is now possible to
  install any top-level component in Nixpkgs directly, through the web
  — see, e.g., <link
  xlink:href='http://catamaran.labs.cs.uu.nl/dist/nixpkgs-0.8/' />.
  All you have to do is associate
  <filename>/nix/bin/nix-install-package</filename> with the MIME type
  <literal>application/nix-package</literal> (or the extension
  <filename>.nixpkg</filename>), and clicking on a package link will
  cause it to be installed, with all appropriate dependencies.  If you
  just want to install some specific application, this is easier than
  subscribing to a channel.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para><command>nix-store -r
  <replaceable>PATHS</replaceable></command> now builds all the
  derivations PATHS in parallel.  Previously it did them sequentially
  (though exploiting possible parallelism between subderivations).
  This is nice for build farms.</para></listitem>

    </para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>Install a store derivation directly (bypassing the
    Nix expression language entirely):

    <screen>
$ nix-env -i /nix/store/z58v41v21xd3...-aterm-2.3.1.drv</screen>

    (This is used to implement <command>nix-install-package</command>,
    which is therefore immune to evolution in the Nix expression
    language.)</para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>Install an already built store path directly:

    as a command-line argument:

    <screen>

    The difference with the normal installation mode is that
    <option>-E</option> does not use the <varname>name</varname>
    attributes of derivations.  Therefore, this can be used to
    disambiguate multiple derivations with the same
    name.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>A hash of the contents of a store path is now stored
  in the database after a succesful build.  This allows you to check

  <listitem>

    <para>Implemented a concurrent garbage collector.  It is now

    <para>However, there can still be GC races if you use

  <listitem><para>Binary patching.  When upgrading components using
  pre-built binaries (through nix-pull / nix-channel), Nix can
  automatically download and apply binary patches to already installed
  components instead of full downloads.  Patching is “smart”: if there
  is a <emphasis>sequence</emphasis> of patches to an installed
  component, Nix will use it.  Patches are currently generated
  automatically between Nixpkgs (pre-)releases.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Simplifications to the substitute
  mechanism.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Nix-pull now stores downloaded manifests in
  <filename>/nix/var/nix/manifests</filename>.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Metadata on files in the Nix store is canonicalised
  after builds: the last-modified timestamp is set to 0 (00:00:00
  1/1/1970), the mode is set to 0444 or 0555 (readable and possibly
  executable by all; setuid/setgid bits are dropped), and the group is
  set to the default.  This ensures that the result of a build and an
  installation through a substitute is the same; and that timestamp
  dependencies are revealed.</para></listitem>
