The Nix Emacs mode supports syntax highlighting, somewhat sensible
indenting, and refilling of comments.

To enable Nix mode in Emacs, add something like this to your ~/.emacs
file:

  (load "/nix/share/emacs/site-lisp/nix-mode.el")

This automatically causes Nix mode to be activated for all files with
extension `.nix'.
